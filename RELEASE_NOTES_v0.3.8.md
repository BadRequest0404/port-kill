# Port-Kill v0.3.8 Release Notes

## 🛠️ Code Quality Improvements

### Fixed All Rust Compiler Warnings
- **✅ Clean Compilation**: Resolved all compiler warnings for better code quality
- **🔧 Unused Variables**: Fixed unused parameter warnings in file monitoring
- **📦 Dead Code**: Properly handled unused struct fields with underscore prefix
- **🪟 Windows Methods**: Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to Windows-specific methods for future use

### Technical Details
- Fixed unused `file_path` parameter in `file_monitor.rs`
- Renamed unused struct fields to use underscore prefix:
  - `suspicious_only` → `_suspicious_only` in `SecurityAuditor`
  - `timeout` → `_timeout` in `EndpointMonitor`
  - `last_processes` → `_last_processes` in `ScriptEngine`
- Added dead code allowances for Windows-specific file monitoring methods

## 🚀 Benefits

- **Cleaner Build Output**: No more compiler warnings cluttering build logs
- **Better Code Quality**: Improved maintainability and professional standards
- **Future-Ready**: Windows-specific methods preserved for future enhancements
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Clean builds for automated deployment pipelines

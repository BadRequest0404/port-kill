# Port-Kill v0.4.0 Release Notes

## üöÄ **MAJOR RELEASE: File-Based Process Management**

This is a **major release** that introduces revolutionary **file-based process management** capabilities, transforming port-kill from a port management tool into a comprehensive development environment protector.

### üÜï **NEW: File-Based Process Management**

#### **Cross-Platform File Process Detection**
- **Windows**: Uses PowerShell and handle.exe for file handle detection
- **Linux**: Uses `lsof` command for file process detection  
- **macOS**: Uses `lsof` command (same as Linux)
- **Universal**: Works seamlessly across all platforms

#### **New File-Based Commands**
- **`killFile("filename.ext")`** - Kill all processes that have a specific file open
- **`killFileExt(".extension")`** - Kill all processes that have files with a specific extension open
- **`guardFile("filename.ext")`** - Guard a file - kill any process that opens it
- **`guardFile("filename.ext", "allowedProcess")`** - Only allow a specific process to open the file
- **`listFileProcesses("filename.ext")`** - List all processes that have a specific file open

### üéØ **Game-Changing Use Cases**

#### **Development Workflow Protection**
```bash
# Kill processes holding package-lock.json (npm conflicts)
./port-kill-console --script "killFile('package-lock.json')"

# Guard your .env file from unauthorized access
./port-kill-console --script "guardFile('.env')"

# Clear all lock files that might cause conflicts
./port-kill-console --script "killFileExt('.lock')"
```

#### **Build System Cleanup**
```bash
# Kill processes with build artifacts
./port-kill-console --script "killFileExt('.o')"

# Kill processes with log files
./port-kill-console --script "killFileExt('.log')"
```

#### **File Lock Resolution**
```bash
# Kill processes preventing file deletion
./port-kill-console --script "killFile('locked-file.txt')"
```

### üìÅ **New Example Scripts**

- **`examples/file-guard-simple.js`** - Basic file guarding
- **`examples/file-cleanup.js`** - File cleanup workflows
- **`examples/file-guard-whitelist.js`** - Whitelist-based file guarding
- **`examples/development-guard.js`** - Comprehensive development environment protection

### üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Port Guarding (from v0.3.x)**

- **`guardPort(port)`** - Automatically kill any process that binds to this port
- **`guardPort(port, allowedName)`** - Only allow a specific process name on this port
- **`killOnPort(port)`** - Alternative syntax for guardPort(port)

### üîß **Technical Improvements**

#### **Cross-Platform File Monitoring**
- **Platform-specific implementations** for optimal performance
- **Real-time file handle detection** using native OS tools
- **Process-to-file mapping** with comprehensive error handling
- **Integration with existing port guarding** system

#### **Build System Updates**

```

#### **Team Development Coordination**
```bash
# Protect team's critical files
./port-kill-console --script "guardFile('package.json'); guardFile('yarn.lock'); guardFile('config.json')"
```

#### **CI/CD Integration**
```bash
# Clean up before builds
./port-kill-console --script "killFileExt('.lock'); killFileExt('.log'); killFile('package-lock.json')"

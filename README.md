# ðŸš§ Port Kill

A lightweight macOS status bar app that monitors and manages development processes running on ports 2000-6000. The app provides real-time process detection and allows you to kill individual processes or all processes at once.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Scans ports 2000-6000 every 5 seconds using `lsof` commands
- **Visual Status Bar Icon**: Shows process count with color-coded center (green=0, red=1-9, orange=10+)
- **Dynamic Context Menu**: Updates every 3 seconds with current processes and kill options
- **One-Click Process Killing**: Click any menu item to kill all detected processes
- **Safe Process Termination**: Uses SIGTERM â†’ SIGKILL termination strategy
- **Stable Architecture**: Built with winit event loop for macOS compatibility
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Handles permission errors and process failures
- **No Windows**: Pure status bar application with no main window

## Status Bar Icon

The status bar icon provides instant visual feedback:

- **Green**: 0 processes (safe, no development servers)
- **Red**: 1-9 processes (some development servers)
- **Orange**: 10+ processes (many development servers)

Hover over the icon to see the exact process count in the tooltip.

## Menu Options

- **Kill All Processes**: Terminates all detected development processes
- **Individual Process Entries**: Format: "Kill: Port 3001: node (PID 1234)"
- **Quit**: Exits the application

**Note**: Currently, clicking any menu item will kill all processes (for testing purposes).

## Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or later
- Rust 1.70 or later
- `lsof` command (included with macOS)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd port-kill
```

2. Build the application:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Run the application (easy way):
```bash
./run.sh
```

4. Run manually (alternative):
```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Run `./run.sh` to start the application
2. **Monitor Status**: Check the status bar for the process count indicator
3. **Access Menu**: Click on the status bar icon to open the context menu
4. **Kill Processes**: 
   - Click "Kill All Processes" to terminate all development processes
   - Click individual process entries to kill specific processes
5. **Quit**: Click "Quit" to exit the application

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Main Thread**: Handles UI events and menu interactions with winit event loop
- **Process Monitor**: Scans for processes every 5 seconds using `lsof`
- **Menu Updates**: Updates context menu every 3 seconds when processes change
- **Process Killing**: Runs in background threads to maintain UI responsiveness

### Process Detection

The application uses the following command to detect processes:
```bash
lsof -ti :PORT -sTCP:LISTEN
```

### Process Termination

1. **SIGTERM**: First attempts graceful termination
2. **SIGKILL**: If process doesn't terminate within 500ms, forces termination

### Port Range

Monitors ports 2000-6000 (broad range covering common development server ports)

### Icon Design

- Clean white background for subtle appearance
- Color-coded center area for quick status assessment
- No borders for modern, minimal aesthetic

## Dependencies

- `tray-icon`: macOS status bar integration
- `winit`: Event loop management
- `nix`: Signal handling for process termination
- `crossbeam-channel`: Thread communication
- `tokio`: Async runtime
- `anyhow`: Error handling
- `serde`: Data serialization

## Development

### Building for Development

```bash
cargo build
```

### Running with Logging

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter permission errors when trying to kill processes:

1. Ensure the application has the necessary permissions
2. Some system processes may be protected
3. Check if the process is owned by another user

### Process Not Detected

If a process is not being detected:

1. Verify the process is listening on a port in the 2000-6000 range
2. Check if the process is using TCP (not UDP)
3. Ensure the process is in LISTEN state

### Application Not Starting

If the application fails to start:

1. Check if another instance is already running
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Check system logs for error messages

## Security Notes

### Process Access
- The application requires access to process information and termination capabilities
- Uses `lsof` command to detect processes listening on ports 2000-6000
- Requires appropriate permissions to send termination signals to processes

### Process Termination
- Uses standard Unix signals: SIGTERM (graceful) â†’ SIGKILL (force) after 500ms
- Only terminates processes that are listening on the monitored port range
- Cannot terminate system processes or processes owned by other users without proper permissions

### Data Privacy
- **No data collection**: The application does not collect, store, or transmit any data
- **No network communication**: All operations are local to your machine
- **No logging of sensitive information**: Only process counts and basic metadata are logged

### Permissions Required
- **Process monitoring**: Read access to process information via `lsof`
- **Process termination**: Ability to send signals to processes you own
- **Status bar access**: Standard macOS status bar permissions

### Limitations
- Cannot terminate processes owned by other users (requires sudo)
- Cannot terminate system processes or services
- Limited to TCP processes in LISTEN state on specified ports
